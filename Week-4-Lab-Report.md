#  CSE15L Week 4 Lab Report: Testing and Searching For Bugs and Symptoms

For this week, I had forked the MarkdownParse.java file from the CSE15L Github Repository and created test files to test MarkdownParse's getLinks method via command line args. 
Testing the method with unique test files caused errors such as wrong output, the file freezing/hanging, and exceptions. With this, my lab group and I made changes to fix 
or improve the code provided in Labs 3 and 4.
